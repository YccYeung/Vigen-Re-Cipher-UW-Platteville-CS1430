# Vigen-re-cipher-project


"""
    Purpose:  To write a Python solution that will encrypt and decrypt a message
    using a Vigenère cipher. Pseudocode to encrypt a message:
    1.	Initialize an empty string.
    2.	For each letter in the plaintext message:
        a.	Determine which letter of the key to use.
        b.	Using the key letter, look up the ciphertext letter in the
            Vigenère square in the plaintext character column.
        c.	Add the ciphertext letter to the ciphertext message.
    3.	Return the resulting string as the ciphertext message.
